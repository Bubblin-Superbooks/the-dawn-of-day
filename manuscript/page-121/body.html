In his youth he had done his best to satisfy it, thirsting as he did for that highest distinction which the Jews could imagineâ€”this people, which raised the imagination of moral loftiness to a greater elevation than any other people, and which alone succeeded   in uniting the conception of a holy God with the idea of sin considered as an offence against this holiness. St. Paul became at once the fanatic defender and guard-of-honour of this God and His Law. Ceaselessly battling against and lying in wait for all transgressors of this Law and those who presumed to doubt it, he was pitiless and cruel towards all evil-doers, whom he would fain have punished in the most rigorous fashion possible.</p></div> </div>
