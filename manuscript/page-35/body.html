In the same way, man has attributed a moral relationship to everything that exists, throwing the cloak of <em>ethical significance</em> over the world's shoulders. One day all that will be of just as much value, and no more, as the amount of belief existing to-day in the masculinity or femininity of the sun.</p><p>Against the Fanciful Disharmony of the Spheres.—We must once more sweep out of the world all this <em>false</em> grandeur, for it is contrary to the justice that all things about us may claim. And for this reason we must not see or wish the world to be more disharmonic than it is!</p></div> </div>
