<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Christianity; that is, a peculiarly simplified Christianity. A God who, in his love, ordains everything so that it may be best for us, a God who gives us our virtue and our happiness and then takes them away from us, so that everything at length goes on smoothly and there is no reason left why we should take life ill or grumble about it: in short, resignation and modesty raised to the rank of divinities—that is the best and most lifelike remnant of Christianity now left to us. It must be remembered, however, that in this way Christianity has developed into a soft <em>moralism</em>: instead of “God, freedom, and immortality,” we have now a kind of benevolence and honest sentiments, and the belief that, in the entire universe, benevolence   and honest sentiments will finally prevail: this is the euthanasia of Christianity.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">What is Truth?—Who will not be pleased with the conclusions which the faithful take such delight in</p></div> </div>
