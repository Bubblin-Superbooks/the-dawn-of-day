But man has created sin, and why, then, should he disown this only child of his merely because it is not regarded with a friendly eye by God, its grandfather? Is that human? Honour to whom honour is due—but one's heart and duty must speak, above all, in favour of the child—and only in the second place for the honour of the grandfather!”</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The Theological Attack.—“You must arrange that with yourself; for your life is at stake!”—Luther it is</p></div> </div>
